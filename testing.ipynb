    "\n",
    "It's long since been the vision of Hollywood that robots and humans would be side-by-side. In some Hollywood films, this partnership is a recipe for catastrophe, but in this suburb not far from Tinseltown, AI and robots are working in a restaurant kitchen. \n",
    "\n",
    "The restaurant, called CaliExpress, can be found in the heart of Pasadena, California. It's the first time that so much technology has been in one place, according to business owner Vic Aulakh. \n",
    "\n",
    "The burger joint uses a grill robot by Cucina and \"Flippy,\" a robot from Miso Robotics that can handle frying. Both robots can make quite a lot of food: Flippy can make 250 pounds of French fries an hour, and the grill robot can cook about 100 patties in that time. Neither machine needs a break or a day off. \n",
    "\n",
    "\"We can't get enough people to come out and work on the fryer and grills,\" Aulakh said. \"They're dangerous jobs and this automation helps solve a lot of those issues we're having.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Flippy can also be found in chain restaurants like White Castle and Jack in the Box. Rob Anderson, a co-founder of Miso Robotics, said that the company started working on the automaton six years ago. \n",
    "\n",
    "\"Flippy is really good at repetitive tasks like operating the fryer in those dangerous environments,\" Anderson said. \"That way, the people working the restaurant can focus on the human element.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "CaliExpress isn't just using robot chefs. The ordering system at the restaurant is powered by artificial intelligence and uses facial recognition software run by Pop ID to keep track of food choices and payment. The technology's creator says that the system is not used for surveillance. \n",
    "\n",
    "There will be some human employees at CaliExpress, too. The restaurant plans on only hiring two \"back of house\" employees to put finishing touches on a meal. That's a fraction of hiring for a non-automated kitchen. In a state where the minimum wage for fast food workers will soon be $20 an hour, having less people to pay can be a bonus for businesses. \n",
    "\n",
    "\"It does reduce some jobs, but there's so many more jobs created with the technology as well as maintaining this technology,\" Aulakh said. \n",
    "\n",
    "A study published this week by researchers at MIT found that just a small amount of jobs could be done by AI, but in most cases, it doesn't make economic sense to use AI to do the necessary work. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a December 2023 government report listed AI as a threat to financial stability. One study found that 82 percent of restaurant jobs could be handled by robotics, an important statistic in an industry that often struggles with understaffing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both robots are rented, and technicians monitor them 24/7. Those technicians can take over cooking if something goes wrong with the robots during meal times. \n",
    "\n",
    "\"If for any reason Flippy's not working, they can flip the barrier up and cook manually as they would normally,\" Anderson said. \n",
    "\n",
    "Aulakh said that hopefully, the robots will also affect the taste of the restaurant's food - for the better. \n",
    "\n",
    "\"Now, each burger is being cooked precisely the same way every time,\" Aulakh said.\n",

    "Bill Gates on stage at TC Sessions: Climate 2022\n",
    "Image Credits: TechCrunch\n",
    "The robotics industry loves a good, healthy debate. Of late, one of the most intense ones centers around humanoid robots. It’s been a big topic for decades, of course, but the recent proliferation of startups like 1X and Figure — along with projects from more established companies like Tesla — have put humanoids back in the spotlight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proponents of the form factor point out that we’ve built our world to fit ourselves, so it makes sense that we would build robots like ourselves to fit it. There are also certain advantages in terms of reach, the ability to walk up stairs and the dexterity that comes with our design.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, anyone who tells you that the human body is the pinnacle of organic machinery is either misinformed or lying to you. I’ve spent the past year dealing with degenerative disc disease, a perfect testament to our imperfect design.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agility Robotics picking and stacking\n",
    "Image Credits: Agility Robotics(opens in a new window)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The form factor also flies in the face of decades of conventional wisdom that has championed single-purpose robots – that is, machines that are built to do one thing extremely well a whole lot of times. And then there’s the whole “general purpose” part, which tends to get tossed around with little thought to its underlying complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Humanoid robots can, however, now claim a big tech name among their ranks. Bill Gates this week issued a list of “cutting-edge robotics startups and labs that I’m excited about.” Among the names are three companies focused on developing humanoids. The first and most prominent is Agility, whose Digit robot looks the least like a human of the three. Also included are Apollo-maker Apptronik and UCLA’s RoMeLa (Robotics and Mechanisms Lab), which is behind the soccer-playing ARTEMIS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s what Gates has to say about Apptronik,\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What’s more useful: multiple robots that can each do one task over and over, or one robot that can do multiple tasks and learn to do even more? To Apptronik, an Austin-based start-up that spun out of the human-centered robotics lab at the University of Texas, the answer is obvious. So they’re building “general-purpose” humanoid bi-pedal robots like Apollo, which can be programmed to do a wide array of tasks—from carrying boxes in a factory to helping out with household chores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Astra\n",
    "Image Credits: Apptronik(opens in a new window)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing about Agility, he notes, “If we want robots to operate in our environments as seamlessly as possible, perhaps those robots should be modeled after people.” Digit is currently ahead of the pack in terms of real-world deployments, including a recent pilot at Amazon warehouses that helped set the stage for Figure’s recent BMW deal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other firms mentioned in the piece include robotic perception firm Field AI and Tevel, which builds apple-picking drones.\n",
    "\n",
    "An endorsement like this might not move the needle too far in the humanoid direction, and Gates is very much not a roboticist. It is, however, enlightening to see the form factor continue to gain more mainstream legitimacy by the day.''', '''A robot surgeon is headed to the ISS to dissect simulated astronaut tissue\n",

    "Very soon, a robot surgeon may begin its orbit around our planet — and though it won't quite be a metallic, humanoid machine wearing a white coat and holding a scalpel, its mission is fascinating nonetheless.\n",
    "\n",
    "On Tuesday (Jan. 30), scientists will be sending a slew of innovative experiments to the International Space Station via Northrop Grumman's Cygnus spacecraft. It's scheduled to launch no earlier than 12:07 p.m. ET (1707 GMT) and, if all goes to plan, arrive at the ISS a few days later on Feb. 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed one of the experiments onboard is a two-pound (0.9-kilogram) robotic device, about as long as your forearm, with two controllable arms that respectively hold a grasper and a pair of scissors. Developed by a company named Virtual Incision, this doctor robot of sorts is built to someday be able to communicate with human doctors on the ground while inserting itself into an astronaut patient to conduct medical procedures with high accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "\"The more advanced part of our experiment will control the device from here in Lincoln, Nebraska, and dissect simulated surgical tissue on orbit,\" Shane Farritor, co-founder of Virtual Incision, said during a presentation about Cygnus on Friday.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, as it's in preliminary stages, it's going to be tested on rubber bands — but the team has high hopes for the future as missions to the moon, Mars and beyond start rolling down the space exploration pipeline. Remote space medicine has become a hot topic during the last few years as space agencies and private space companies lay plans for a variety of future crewed space missions. \n",

    "NASA's Artemis Program, for instance, hopes to have boots on the moon in 2026 — plus, that's supposed to pave the way for a day on which humanity can say they've reached the Red Planet. And together, those missions are expected to pave the way for a far future in which humanity embarks on deeper space travel, perhaps to Venus or, if we're really dreaming, beyond the solar system. So to make sure astronauts remain safe in space — an environment they're literally not made to survive in — scientists want to make sure space-based medical treatment sees advancement in tandem with the rockets that'll take those astronauts wherever they're going. \n",
    "\n",
    "A quick example that comes to mind is how, in 2021, NASA flight surgeon Josef Schmid was \"holoported\" to the ISS via HoloLens technology. It's sort of like virtual reality meets FaceTime meets augmented reality, if that makes sense.\n",

    "However, as the team explains, not only could this robotic surgery mission benefit people exploring the void of space, but also those living right here on Earth. \"If you have a specialist who's a very good surgeon, that specialist could dial into different locations and help with telesurgery or remote surgery,\" Farritor said. \"Only about 10% of operating rooms today are robotic, but we don't see any reason that shouldn't be 100%.\"\n",

(Image credit: NASA/Virtual Incision)\n",
    "This would be a particularly crucial advantage for hospitals in rural areas where fewer specialists are available, and where operating rooms are limited. In fact, as Farritor explained, not only is Virtual Incision funded by NASA but also by the military. \"Both groups want to do surgery in crazy places,\" he said, \"and our small robots kind of lend themselves to mobility like that.\"\n",

Researchers plan to compare procedures in microgravity and on Earth to evaluate the effects of microgravity and time delays between space and ground. (Image credit: NASA/Virtual Incision)\n",
    "What else is going up? \n",
    "The little robot doctor will be far from alone on the Cygnus spacecraft as it heads to the ISS; during the same presentation in which Farritor discussed Virtual Incision, other experts talked about what they'll be sending up come Monday.\n",
    "\n",
    "For one, it'll have a robot friend joining it in the orbital laboratory — a robotic arm. This arm has already been tested within the station's constraints before, but with this new mission the team hopes to test it in fully unpressurized conditions. \n",
    "\n",
    "\"Unplugging, replugging, moving objects, that's the kind of stuff that we did with the first investigation,\" said May Murphy, the director of programs at company NanoRacks. \"We're kind of stepping up the complexity ... we're going to switch off which tools we're using, we'll be able to use screwdriver analogs and things like that; that will enable us to do even more work.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "\"We can look at even beyond just taking away something that the crew would have to spend time working on,\" she continued. \"Now, we also have the capacity to do additional work in harsher environments we don't necessarily want to expose the crew to.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "The European Space Agency, meanwhile, will be sending a 3D-printer that can create small metal parts. The goal here is to see how the structure of 3D-printed metal fares in space when compared to Earth-based 3D-printed metal. 3D-printed semiconductors, key components of most electronic devices, will be tested as well for a similar reason.\n",

    "\"When we talk about having vehicles in space for longer periods of time without being able to bring supplies up and down, we need to be able to print some of these smaller parts in space, to help the integrity of the vehicle over time,\" said Meghan Everett, NASA's ISS program deputy scientist. \n",

    "Per Everett, this could also help scientists learn whether some sorts of materials that aren't 3D-printable on Earth can be 3D-printed in space. \"Some preliminary data suggests that we can actually produce better products in space compared to Earth which would directly translate to better electronics in energy producing capabilities,\" she said.\n",

    "Another experiment getting launched on Monday looks at the effects of microgravity on bone loss. Known as MABL-A, it will look at the role of what're known as mesenchymal cells (associated with bone marrow) and how that might change when exposed to the space environment. This could offer insight into astronaut bone loss — a well-documented, major issue for space explorers — as well as into the dynamics of human aging. \"We will also look at the genes that are involved in bone formation and how gravity affected them,\" said Abba Zubair, a professor of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology at Mayo Clinic.\n",

    "Computers and retinas\n",
    "Two of the other key experiments discussed during the presentation include a space computer and an artificial eye — well, an artificial retina, to be exact. We'll start with the latter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nicole Wagner, CEO of a company named LambdaVision, has a staggering goal: To restore vision to the millions of patients that are blinded by end stage retinal degenerative diseases like macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, she and her team are trying to develop a protein-based artificial retina that's built through a process known as \"electrostatic layer-by-layer deposition.\" In short, this consists of depositing multiple layers of a special kind of protein onto a scaffold. \"Think of the scaffold almost like a tightly woven piece of gauze,\" Wagner said. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, as she explains, this process on Earth can be impeded by the effects of gravity. And any imperfections in the layers can pretty much ruin the artificial retina's performance. So …  what about in microgravity? To date, LambdaVision has flown more than eight missions to the ISS, she says, and the experiments have shown that microgravity does indeed generate more homogenous layers and therefore better thin films for the retina.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"In this mission,\" she said, \"we're looking at sending a powdered form of bacteriorhodopsin to the ISS that will then be resuspended into a solution, and we will be using special instruments, in this case spectrometers, to look at the protein quality and purity on the International Space Station, as well as to validate this process used to get the protein into solution.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Could you imagine if doctors would be able to commission a few artificial retinas to be developed in space someday, then delivered to the ground for implantation into a patient. And that this whole process could give someone their sight back?\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the space computer, Mark Fernandez, principal investigator for the Spaceborne Computer-2 project, posed a hypothetical. \"Astronauts go on a spacewalk, and after their work day, the gloves are examined for wear-and-tear,' he said. \"This must be done by every astronaut, after every spacewalk, before the gloves can be used again.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, Fernandez explains, the team takes a bunch of high-resolution photographs of the potentially contaminated gloves, then sends those images out for analysis. \n",

    "Droughts in the Western U.S. have risen to an \"unprecedented\" level since the 16th century, a new study has revealed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Hot drought\" refers to concurrent drought conditions that are stretching across the country, largely because of climate change. The study from multi-institutional researchers, published in the journal Science, found that these severe conditions have been increasing in not just severity but how often they have occurred over the past 100 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get these findings, lead author Karen King and colleagues combined summer temperatures in the U.S. from 1553 to 2020 by analyzing tree rings, which show temperature changes through soil moisture. They discovered that the past 20 years in the Western U.S. have been the hottest in over five centuries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"If anthropogenic warming continues according to model projections, we might assume that anthropogenic drying has only just begun,\" King, an assistant professor of physical geography at the University of Tennessee, told Newsweek. \"Furthermore, we might expect the frequency of compound hot and dry conditions—hot drought—to increase over the course of this century.\"\n",

    "\"Individual climatic events can have serious effects on agriculture, infrastructure, and ecosystems, but compounding hazards can result in cascading and intensified consequences for these systems,\" the authors write in the study.\n",

    "They went on: \"The combination of anomalous heat with rainfall deficits have already led to droughts that are substantially more intense because of high temperatures and elevated vapor pressure deficits and have thus been called hot droughts.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "The Colorado River Basin is seeing a concerning drop in water levels as drought causes a lack of seasonal precipitation. Important Colorado River reservoirs like Lake Mead are showing how dire the situation is. In the summer of 2022, the reservoir reached its lowest level ever recorded. Since then, the water levels have remained at only around 30 percent capacity.\n",

    "\"The increasing prevalence of hot drought over the 20th and 21st centuries has important implications for future regional climate change adaptation strategies and for water resource management, particularly in the most historically drought-prone regions,\" the study said.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"This study aims to evaluate the relationship between summer average maximum temperatures and summer soil moisture over the last 500 years,\" King said. \"Our main research questions are, [firstly] how might we characterize or quantify the relationship between summer maximum temperature and summer soil moisture during this modern period of megadrought conditions for much of western North America compared to during past megadrought periods over the last 500 years? [And secondly,] has the frequency of compound hot and dry summers increased over the 20th-21st centuries compared to the past ca. 500 years?\"\n",

So maybe Bezos is just a fanboy who shot his shot in the singer’s DMs. Then again, there were also reports back in 2021 that Bey and Jay vacationed on a 450-foot megayacht (which is longer than a football field, in case you were wondering) belonging to Bezos.

    "Parkhotel employees in Eisenstadt, Austria, celebrate the arrival of service robots. Source: Pudu Robotics\n",
    "\n",
    "Commercial service robots are more common in East Asia than elsewhere, but the rest of the world could catch up in 2024, according to Pudu Technology Co. The Shenzhen, China-based company claimed that it is China’s top exporter of such robots.\n",
    "\n",
    "“If 2023 was the year of GenAI, I believe 2024 will be the year of the robot,” stated Felix Zhang, founder and CEO of Pudu Robotics. “While humanoid robots and food-making robots grabbed headlines in 2023, the untold story is that it’s the humble service robot — robots that skillfully deliver items and clean floors, often in high-traffic areas — that are actually ready to scale in 2024.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Last year, Pudu Robotics said it deployed robots across 600 cities in 60 countries. The company also partnered with SoftBank and Nippon Otis Elevators, opened its autonomous mobile robot (AMR) management platform to developers, and won Red Dot and iF Design awards. In addition, it raised more than $15 million in Series C3 funding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Zhang discussed Pudu’s current offerings and his outlook for this year with The Robot Report:\n",
    "\n",
    "Service robots to take on more healthcare roles\n",
    "You have predicted more robots in hospitals and senior living facilities. Does Pudu offer robotics specifically for elder care?\n",
    "\n",
    "Zhang: Pudu Robotics offers several robots that are deployed in senior living facilities to assist facility staff and residents in their day-to-day tasks and improve the emotional well-being of the elderly. The robots include the BellaBot and KettyBot, two models of delivery robots that can serve food or medicine, assist with returning items, and in some cases even interact with residents.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, although it’s not designed to interact with residents, the PUDU CC1 cleaning robot can help keep senior living facilities tidy, as it is designed to scrub, sweep, vacuum and mop in care homes and other commercial settings. These capabilities automate menial tasks for overwhelmed workers and set the standard for hygiene in autonomous cleaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a chain elderly care institution in Hong Kong, which operates 12 nursing homes with 1,600 beds, has adopted CC1 for cleaning the internal environment, reducing the workload of the staff.\n",
    "\n",
    "PUDU’s robots are especially timely, as more than 1 in 6 Americans are now 65 years or older, and life expectancy continues to grow, thanks to medical advancements. Our aging population is contributing to a major healthcare staffing crisis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next 12 months will see the increased adoption of robots in healthcare, as short-staffed senior-living facilities employ the technology to complete tasks. They can monitor daily routines, provide reminders for medication schedules, detect changes in body temperature, and warn medical professionals and families of any abnormalities. \n",
    "\n",
    "Robots can also provide emotional support for the elderly and robot-assisted living will become a crucial asset for the growing elderly population. Loneliness is a common problem for many older people, robots provide company and can engage in activities such as communication, storytelling, and playing music.\n",
    "\n",
    "The traditional way of caring for the elderly often falls short of meeting all of their needs, and robots are able to fill the gaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Pudu addresses global markets, economic headwinds\n",
    "How is the U.S. market for service robots growing in comparison with other regions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Zhang: The global market for service robots is soaring, and the U.S. is beginning to catch up with its peers in Asia. According to the International Federation of Robotics [IFR], a non-profit industry association, sales of robots used in the service industry grew by 37% worldwide in 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2024, the U.S. market is expected to generate the most revenue in the service robot industry, but regions like Japan are leading the way in development and adoption of the technology. In many developing countries, the service industry is hobbled by ever-mounting challenges in hiring workers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In response, Pudu Robotics has engaged in a massive expansion beyond the borders of its home market since 2020, achieving rapid growth in shipments. Pudu leads the global market as China’s No. 1 service robot exporter, and cumulative global shipments are over 70,000 units. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the U.S., employers facing staff shortages have turned to commercial service robots to provide relief for their remaining workers. Quick-service restaurants [QSRs], for example, expect 51% of tasks to be automated by 2025, while full-service restaurants expect to automate 27% of tasks. Service robots are automating menial tasks, improving overall efficiency, and preventing burnout among their human colleagues. \n",
    "\n",
    "While the challenge of labor shortages is universal, how will robotics adoption overcome current economic headwinds?\n",
    "\n",
    "Zhang: Currently, there are 4 million more open jobs than there are available workers in the U.S. to fill them. As society’s tolerance and acceptance of new technology grows, robots will plug this hole.\n",
    "\n",
    "U.S. restaurants are a prime example. Owners face a “perfect storm” of an aging population, soaring child-care costs that shrink the pool of available workers, and a pandemic that pointed many workers towards more stable careers.\n",
    "\n",
    "While economic headwinds may cause some delay, the world is still turning towards an increasingly automated future. Robots are the long-term solution for massive problems facing several industries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Integration and AI to make robots more useful\n",
    "From hospitality to healthcare and retail, which areas have the most demand? How much integration will be necessary?\n",
    "\n",
    "Zhang: We’re seeing an increase in demand for service robots most from the restaurant industry, followed by hospitality, healthcare, and retail by order of demand increase. To meet that global demand, Pudu Robotics is building two new factories near Shanghai that will triple the company’s annual capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Businesses across all four categories are finding it hard to maintain adequate service levels due to staffs being stretched thin. Integration will happen across these industries, as they all are dealing with the effects of the labor shortage. Business will still need human workers, but robots can supplement and improve efficiencies. \n",
    "\n",
    "While large language models (LLMs) are improving human-machine interactions, how will they be instantiated in robots rather than on tablets and phones?\n",
    "\n",
    "Zhang: Large language models can effectively enhance human-robot interaction, particularly in semantic understanding. Take, for instance, a robot serving as a shopping guide in a supermarket.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, to find a specific brand of electric toothbrushes, customers needed to navigate through “personal care,” then “toothbrushes,” followed by “electric toothbrushes,” and finally the brand. With significant improvements in voice recognition and semantic understanding, it’s now possible to locate the item directly through a single command. \n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are highly beneficial for advancing end-to-end algorithms in modules such as positioning, navigation, and perception, significantly enhancing the efficiency of their evolution to achieve global optimization. Robots and LLM integration is already under way, but manufacturers need to ensure that the generated content aligns with human values and safety standards, while also ensuring that robots can reliably and responsibly interact with the real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2024, these models will be used effectively in robots — as well as tablets and phones — as robots with AI voice interactions and eye-catching displays make use of the advancing technology.''',\n",

(AP) — The Republican National Committee has pulled a resolution to consider declaring Donald Trump the party’s “presumptive 2024 nominee” before he formally clinches the requisite number of delegates, a person familiar with the decision said Thursday.\n",
    "\n",
    "News of the withdrawal came shortly after Trump posted on his Truth Social site that, while he “greatly” appreciated the notion, he felt, “for the sake of PARTY UNITY, that they should NOT go forward with this plan, but that I should do it the ‘Old Fashioned’ way, and finish the process off AT THE BALLOT BOX.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The measure, according to a draft obtained Thursday by The Associated Press, had said it “declares President Trump as our presumptive 2024 nominee for the office of President of the United States and from this moment forward moves into full general election mode welcoming supporters of all candidates as valued members of Team Trump 2024.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The withdrawal was confirmed by a person familiar with the decision who was not authorized to publicly discuss the proposal and spoke on condition of anonymity Thursday night.\n",

    "Georgia Senate passes a panel with subpoena power to investigate District Attorney Fani Willis\n",
    "If approved, the measure would have further solidified Trump’s control of the party and its operation at a time when former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley is still competing against Trump for the GOP nomination.\n",
    "\n",
    "RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel had earlier signaled her approval for the resolution. On Tuesday, after Haley finished second to Trump in New Hampshire, McDaniel said that while she felt the former ambassador had “run a great campaign,” Republicans “need to unite around our eventual nominee, which is going to be Donald Trump.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The resolution had been expected to be discussed at the RNC’s winter meeting in Las Vegas next week, even though only two states have voted and the former president had nowhere near the requisite number of delegates to secure the nomination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Haley’s camp said Thursday that it wasn’t up to the RNC to decide who the GOP nominee would be.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Who cares what the RNC says? We’ll let millions of Republican voters across the country decide who should be our party’s nominee, not a bunch of Washington insiders,” said campaign spokesperson Olivia Perez-Cubas.\n",
    "\n",
    "The AP has a policy to not refer to any candidate as the “presumptive nominee” until he or she has captured the number of delegates needed to win a majority vote at the national party conventions this summer. The earliest that could happen is March.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there were no party rules prohibiting the RNC from making such a move. If it had been adopted, it could have given the Republican Party a jump-start on planning a general election matchup with Democratic President Joe Biden, who has begun framing his reelection campaign as a 2020 rematch against Trump.\n",

    "There was also precedent for the committee to declare a candidate the presumptive nominee before winning the 1,215 requisite delegates to clinch the nomination. Then-RNC Chair Reince Priebus did so with Trump in May 2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite losing both the Iowa and New Hampshire contests to Trump, Haley has argued that her performance — outlasting all the other Trump rivals — shows the strength of her candidacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trump currently has 32 delegates to Haley’s 17. There is one delegate left to be assigned after the New Hampshire contest.\n",
    "\n",
    "During a rally Wednesday night in her home state of South Carolina, Haley — the former governor — noted that her campaign had brought in more than $1 million since her second-place finish in New Hampshire. Trump followed up with a remark that appeared aimed at intimidating her donors.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Anybody that makes a ‘Contribution’ to Birdbrain, from this moment forth, will be permanently barred from the MAGA camp,” Trump wrote, using the nickname he has crafted for Haley and the abbreviation for his “Make America Great Again” slogan. “We don’t want them, and will not accept them, because we Put America First, and ALWAYS WILL!”\n",
    "\n",
    "Haley’s campaign said Thursday that it raised an additional $1.2 million “after Trump’s unhinged pledge to ‘permanently bar’ any individual who contributed to Haley’s campaign.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Donald Trump’s threats highlight the stark choice in this election: personal vendettas or real conservative leadership,” said Haley spokesperson AnnMarie Graham-Barnes. “Trump’s scheme blew up in his face. The contributions to the Haley campaign are pouring in — proof that people are sick of the drama and are rallying behind Nikki’s vision for a strong and proud America.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Trump’s dismissal of any Haley donors had no effect on T.J. Petrizzo, a former top Capitol Hill staffer and now lobbyist who supports Haley.\n",
    "\n",
    "“That’s something out of a ‘Godfather’ movie. Never betray the family? Come on,” he added. “You’ve got to play this through.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Petrizzo said he understands that some Republicans may be ready to pivot to a head-to-head contest between Trump and Biden, but he notes that there is a lot of time left before a general election.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I’ve heard a lot of elected officials in the Republican Party, including the RNC chair, say, ‘We need to rally around a candidate.’ That this is going to be our candidate. ‘It was chosen by Iowa and New Hampshire, so we must go ahead and rally around Trump,’” Petrizzo said. “Well, there’s 285 days until the election. There’s plenty of time on the clock.”\"\"\"\n",

The lawyers are asking the justices to uphold a Colorado court decision to remove Trump from the state's primary ballot. They emphasize that no one, including a former president, is above the law. The case presents the court with its first look at a provision of the 14th Amendment that bars individuals who engaged in insurrection from holding public office. The lawyers argue that Trump intentionally organized and incited the mob that attacked the Capitol. Trump's lawyers, on the other hand, argue that efforts to keep him off the ballot would disenfranchise millions of Americans and cause chaos.
